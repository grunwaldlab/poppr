If you have found a bug or unexpected result: please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. 
If you have a request for a new feature, please describe in as much detail as possible how the new feature should work with example output. 
**If you have a question, please don't use this form, but instead ask on the mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poppr>**.

Please include a minimal reprex (aka reproducible example). The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://github.com/jennybc/reprex#what-is-a-reprex>, and follow the advice further down the page. Do NOT include session info unless it's explicitly asked for, or you've used `reprex::reprex(..., si = TRUE)` to hide it away.  

*Delete these instructions once you have read them.*
