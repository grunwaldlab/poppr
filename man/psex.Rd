\usage{
psex(gid, pop = NULL, by_pop = TRUE, freq = NULL, G = NULL,
  method = c("single", "multiple"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gid}{a genind or genclone object.}

\item{pop}{either a formula to set the population factor from the 
\code{\link{strata}} slot or a vector specifying the population factor for 
each sample. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{by_pop}{When this is \code{TRUE} (default), the calculation will be
done by population.}

\item{freq}{a vector or matrix of allele frequencies. This defaults to 
\code{NULL}, indicating that the frequencies will be determined via 
round-robin approach in \code{\link{rraf}}. \strong{If this matrix or 
vector is not provided, zero-value allele frequencies will automatically be
corrected.} For details, please see the documentation on
\link[=rare_allele_correction]{correcting rare alleles}.}

\item{G}{an integer specifying the number of observed genets. If NULL, this 
will be the number of original multilocus genotypes.}

\item{method}{which method of calculating psex should be used? Using 
\code{method = "single"} (default) indicates that the calculation for psex 
should reflect the probability of encountering a second genotype. Using 
\code{method = "multiple"} gives the probability of encountering multiple 
samples of the same genotype (see details).}

\item{...}{options from \link[=rare_allele_correction]{correcting rare
alleles}. The default is to correct allele frequencies to 1/n}

\value{
a vector of Psex for each sample.

\description{
Probability of encountering a genotype more than once by chance
}
\details{
Psex is the probability of encountering a given genotype more than 
  once by chance. The basic equation is
  
  \deqn{p_{sex} = 1 - (1 - p_{gen})^{G})}{psex = 1 - (1 - pgen)^G}
  
  where \emph{G} is the number of multilocus genotypes. See
  \code{\link{pgen}} for its calculation. For a given value of alpha (e.g.
  alpha = 0.05), genotypes with psex < alpha can be thought of as a single
  genet whereas genotypes with psex > alpha do not have strong evidence that
  members belong to the same genet (Parks and Werth, 1993).
  
  When \code{method = "multiple"}, the method from Arnaud-Haond et al. (1997)
  is used where the sum of the binomial density is taken:
  
  \deqn{p_{sex} = \sum_{i = 1}^N {N \choose i} \left(p_{gen}\right)^i\left(1
  - p_{gen}\right)^{N - i}}{psex = sum(dbinom(1:N, N, pgen))}
  
  where \emph{N} is the number of samples with the same genotype, \emph{i} is
  the ith sample, and \emph{pgen} is the value of pgen for that genotype.
  
  The function will automatically calculate the round-robin allele
  frequencies with \code{\link{rraf}} and \emph{G} with \code{\link{nmll}}.
}
\note{
The values of Psex represent the value for each multilocus genotype. 
  Additionally, when the argument \code{pop} is not \code{NULL}, 
  \code{by_pop} is automatically \code{TRUE}.
