\title{Simulated data illustrating a Minimum Spanning Network based on Bruvo's
Distance}
\format{a \code{\link{genind}} object with 50 individuals, 10 loci, and four 
  populations.}
\usage{
data(partial_clone)
}
\description{
These data were simulated using SimuPOP version 1.0.8 with 
  99.9\% clonal reproduction over 10,000 generations. Populations were
  assigned post-hoc and are simply present for the purposes of demonstrating
  a minimum spanning network with Bruvo's distance.
