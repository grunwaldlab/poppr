#' Display a greyscale gradient adjusted to specific parameters
#' 
#' This function has one purpose. It is for deciding the appropriate scaling for
#' a grey palette to be used for edge weights of a minimum spanning network.
#' 
#' @param glim "grey limit". Two numbers between zero and one. They determine 
#' the upper and lower limits for the \code{\link{gray}} function. Default is 0
#' (black) and 0.8 (20\% black). 
#' 
#' @param gadj "grey adjust". a positive \code{integer} greater than zero that
#' will serve as the exponent to the edge weight to scale the grey value to
#' represent that weight.
#' 
#' @param gweight "grey weight". an \code{integer}. If it's 1, the grey scale
#' will be weighted to emphasize the differences between closely related nodes.
#' If it is 2, the grey scale will be weighted to emphasize the differences
#' between more distantly related nodes. 
#' 
#' @return A plot displaying a grey gradient from 0.001 to 1 with minimum and 
#' maximum values displayed as yellow lines, and an equation for the correction 
#' displayed in red. 
#'
#' @examples
#' # Normal grey curve with an adjustment of 3, an upper limit of 0.8, and
#' # weighted towards smaller values.
#' greycurve()
#' 
#' # 1:1 relationship grey curve.
#' greycurve(gadj=1, glim=1:0)
#' 
#' # Grey curve weighted towards larger values.
#' greycurve(gweight=2)
#' 
#' # Same as the first, but the limit is 1.
#' greycurve(glim=1:0)
#' 
#' # Setting the lower limit to 0.1 and weighting towards larger values.
