poppr 2.5.0.99
===========

NEW FUNCTIONS
-------------

* The new function `boot.ia()` is conceptually similar to `resample.ia()`,
  except it resamples with replacement. This may be absorbed into `resample.ia()`
  as an extra parameter of "replace".
  
NEW FEATURES
------------

* The function `resample.ia()` now can resample individuals weighted by their
  Psex value. 
* The minimum spanning networks will now scale nodes by area instead of radius.
  This gives a more accurate picture of the differences between MLGs. See
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/154 for details.
* A legend for samples/node is now added to all minimum spanning networks. See
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/158 for details.
* The imsn() option for node size scale has been changed to a slider.
  
BUG FIX
-------

* An issue where data with sample names containing apostrophes could not be
  imported was fixed (Identified in 
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/156).
* a bug in `imsn()` where custom MLGs would result in an error was fixed. See
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/155 for details.
* a bug in `plot_poppr_msn()` where setting `scale.leg = FALSE` would result in a
  very small MSN plot was fixed.
* `mlg()` now works properly for snpclone and genlight objects. See 
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/155 for details.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

* The minimum version of igraph has been set to 1.0.0.

MISC
----

* The MSN is now plotted last in `plot_poppr_msn()` so additional legends can
  be added if necessary.

poppr 2.5.0
===========

ALGORITHMIC CHANGE
------------------

* Identified in https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/139, Bruvo's 
  distance will now consider all possible combinations of ordered alleles in the
  calculation under the genome addition and loss models for missing data. This
  will affect those who have polyploid data that contain more than one missing 
  allele at any genotype
  
  To facilitate comparison, the global option old.bruvo.model, has been created.
  By default it is set to FALSE, indicating that poppr should use the ordered 
  allele combinations. If the user wants to use the method considering unorderd 
  allele combinations, they can set options(old.bruvo.model = TRUE)
  
  It must be repeated that this does not affect haploid or diploid comparisons, 
  those that use the infinite alleles model, or those who do not have more than 
  one missing allele at any genotype.

DEPRECATION
-----------

* The warning for a short repeat length vector for Bruvo's distance is 
  deprecated and will become an error in the future
* jack.ia is deprecated in favor of resample.ia for clarity.
  
BUG FIX
-------

 * A bug in read.genalex() where removed samples would have incorrect strata
   labels was fixed. Thanks to HernÃ¡n Dario Capador-Barreto for identifying it.
   See https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/147.
  
MISC
----

* The internal plotting function for mlg.table now uses tidy evaluation for
  dplyr versions > 0.5.0
* The package reshape2 was removed from imports and replaced with base functions
  (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/144 for details)

NEW IMPORTS
-----------

* Due to the migration to dplyr version 0.7.0, poppr now imports the "!!"
  operator from the rlang package

poppr 2.4.1
===========

BUG FIX
-------

* A corner case where repeat length vectors out of order would be erroneously
  subset with `test_replen()` and `fix_replen()` has been fixed. See
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/136 for details.
* All functions that perform filtering will now run serially due to a bug on
  Fedora machines with at least two threads. Details can be found at
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/138.


poppr 2.4.0
===========

NEW FUNCTIONS
-------------

* `jack.ia()` will randomly jackknife your sample to a specified n (default
  is the number of MLG), and calculate the index of association over 
  multiple iterations, giving a distribution of possible values at a given
  sample size.

NEW FEATURES
------------

* The function `mlg.table()` gains new parameters, "color" and "background". The
  "color" parameter will create a single barplot with colors representing 
  populations while the "background" parameter will create a background plot 
  showing the abundance of MLGs across populations within the facets.
* The function `win.ia()` will now take into consideration chromosomal
  coordinates when constructing windows. It has additionally acquired a new
  parameter `chromosome_buffer`, which allows the user to specify whether or not
  the window should be limited to within chromosomes.
  
NOTABLE CHANGES
---------------

* calculation of MLGs for snpclone and genlight objects will be performed via 
  distance-based methods by default. This is in contrast to the previous behavior
  where individuals were assumed to have unique genotypes. 
  see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/125 for details.
* An error will be thrown when attempting to use `mlg.crosspop()` with an object
  that has < 2 populations.
* `genotype_curve()` will now remove monomorphic loci before calculation by
  default as these loci misleadingly influence the shape of the curve. This will
  change the shape of the curve if you have monomorphic loci. This change IS
  optional via the drop and dropna parameters, but it is not recommended to 
  change these parameters. 
* The calculation for `psex()` has changed to be more accurate when using
  method = "multiple". It also gains the ability to use several values of G,
  one for each population. Documentation for `psex()` has also been improved.
  For details of the change, see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/101

BUG FIX
-------

* The error given when a genlight object is passed to `poppr()` now correctly
  identifies the substitute function as `diversity_stats()` and not diversity
  table (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/123). 
* GenAlEx files imported with duplicate loci will generate a warning telling the
  user that the duplicated loci have been renamed (usually to <locus name>_1)
  (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/122).
* Haplodiploids imported in genalex files will be properly treated 
  (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/124).
* `read.genalex()` will now implicitly check for the correct number of 
  individuals in the data (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/128).
* The function `poppr()` no longer throws an error if the sample > 0 and the 
  data has no population (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/130).
* A bug where round-robin allele frequencies calculated with by_pop = TRUE were
  inaccurate for all but the first population was fixed. For details, see
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/132.
* A potential integer overflow was fixed in `SEXP association_index_haploid`.
  This was a ghost from https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/100.
* PROTECT statements were placed around allocation statements. For details, see
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/133.
  
MISC
----

* The documentation for `bitwise.dist()` clarifies the role of the
  `differences_only` flag (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/119).
* Interruptions in C code is now handled gracefully via `R_CheckUserInterrupt()`.
  The benefit is that long-running calculations are interrupted near instantly, 
  but at the cost of a few more milliseconds of computation time.
  (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/86)
* Bruvo's distance now has complete tests for recursion as of commit 4e4fa40d16

poppr 2.3.0
===========

NEW FUNCTIONS
------------

* The function `bootgen2genind()` will help users take advantage of 
  bootstrapping distance functions from other packages that require genind 
  objects. For details, see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/112 and
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/111

NEW FEATURES
------------

* There is now a `plot` parameter for the genotype curve to enable or suppress
  plotting.
* Progress bars are now automatically suppressed when running non-interactively.
  to turn them on when running non-interactively, use 
  `options(poppr.debug = TRUE)`.
* The progress bar for `ia()` and `poppr()` will now show estimated time. This
  is from dplyr's `progress_estimated()`.

MISC
-----------

* The `hist` argument in the `ia()` is deprecated in favor of `plot`.
* The x axis for the `genotype_curve()` plot is now numeric, allowing you to
  fit a smoothing function over the points without having to use the hack
  `geom_smooth(aes(group = 1))`. This is thanks to Kara Woo for pointing this
  out on twitter (https://twitter.com/kara_woo/status/783336540407685120).
* The "show" method for genclone objects now delimits populations and strata
  by a comma, avoiding confusion with multi-word population names. Thanks to
  @knausb for the fix in https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/pull/116.  
* Documentation for `poppr.amova` now contains a note about significance testing
  with the ade4 function `randtest.amova`.

BUG FIX
-----------

* The subsetting methods will now properly handle mlgs when using sample names
  to subset genclone and snpclone objects. See
  https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/114 for details.
* A plotting bug for `mlg.table()` was fixed so that the plots now show the
  maximum value.
* Bugs with subsetting bootgen and bruvomat objects with no loci specified were 
  fixed. See https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/118 for details.

poppr 2.2.1
===========

BUG FIX
-----------

* A problem exporting haploid sequence data to genalex format was fixed 
  (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/108)
* Data without population structure no longer throws an error in `imsn()`

NEW FEATURES
-----------

* The pipe operator (`%>%`) is now exported from magrittr to make chaining 
  commands easier.
* `mlg.filter()` can now return multiple statistics.
* The user can now control the size of the labels in the index of association 
  plots with the labsize and linesize arguments in the plot method.

* `recode_polyploids()` can now take haplodiploid data.
  
  
BUG FIX
-----------

* An issue that caused errors in the `imsn()` code output was fixed
  (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/93)
* Caught bug where the `mlg.filter()` assignment method was using `nei.dist()`
  instead of `diss.dist()` when no distance was specified.
* A bug that resulted in significantly negative values from `bitwise.ia()` with
  large sample sizes was fixed. Spotted by @knausb
  (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/100)
* Fixed issue where `plot_filter_stats()` wasn't displaying the full range of 
  MLGs
* Color vectors are now correctly parsed when passed to msn functions 
  (see https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/55) for details. Long color
  vectors are now accepted, albiet with warning.
* An issue where `mll.reset()` did not reset non-MLG class objects in the mlg
  slot was fixed. 
  
MISC
-----------

* Documentation for `mlg.filter()` was clarified and updated with more examples.
* The vignette "Migration from poppr version 1" has been removed.
* Previously deprecated `*hierarchy()` functions have been removed.

poppr 2.1.1
===========

NEW FEATURES
-----------

* `imsn()` now has collapsible side panels
* `nmll()` and `mll()` will now handle genind and genlight objects
* `rraf()` now gives options for minor allele correction encompassed in the 
  internal function `rare_allele_correction()`. This extends also to `pgen()` 
  and `psex()`, which must correct minor allele frequencies by default. See 
    https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/81 for details.

NEW TRADITIONALISTS
-----------

* because we're through being cool.

MISC
-----------

* Documentation for genclone and snpclone classes are more coherent.
* Accessors added for internal MLG objects (for developers).
* The genotype accumulation curve displays the iteration and locus number
  instead of a progress bar.
* The genotype accumulation plot is now scaled from 0 to the number of observed
  mlgs.
* Documentation for `poppr.amova` no longer references the "hierarchy" slot.

BUG FIX
-----------

poppr 2.0.0
===========

COMPATIBILITY UPDATE
-----------

* poppr has moved to version 2.0 due to adegenet's recent update. The hierarchy
  slot introduced in version 1.1 is now being moved to adegenet and renamed
  `strata`. For maximum backwards compatibility, all of the hierarchy methods
  still exist, but they are deprecated and will print a warning with the proper
  function to use. If you were accessing the hierarchy slot without using the
  `*hierarchy()` methods, your code will fail as the hierarchy slot now should
  only contain a formula object.

NEW DEPENDENCIES
-----------

* poppr now imports elements from dplyr and shiny
* As required as of 2015-06-29, poppr now explicitly imports: stats, graphics,
  grDevices, and utils

NEW FEATURES
-----------

* The default plot for the index of association will now be a single histogram.
  The user has the option to visualize the standardized index of association
  (`index = "rbarD"`, default) or the classic index of association (`index =
  "Ia"`). If the user uses the function `ia` with the argument `valuereturn =
  TRUE`, then the resulting object can be plotted with the plot function.
* The function `poppr` will now plot all populations in a single faceted plot
  instead of one plot per population.
* `aboot` and `bruvo.boot` will now be able to utilize any function to generate
  trees (suggested in issue #18).
* The mlg slot in the genclone object can now optionally hold an MLG class
  object. This object will contain different definitions of multilocus
  genotypes, allowing the user to switch between observed, custom, and mlgs
  defined given a genetic distance threshold.
* minimum spanning network functions gain the ability to include reticulations
  using the option `include.ties`
* minimum spanning network functions gain the ability to collapse multilocus
  genotypes by genetic distance with the option `threshold`.
* `poppr.amova` gains the ability to filter multilocus genotypes before
  calculation.
* `informloci` gains the argument "MAF", which allows the specification of a
  minor allele frequency cutoff in addition to the cutoff argument. Examples
  have been updated.
* `aboot` can now take genlight objects.
* `poppr.msn` and `plot_poppr_msn` can now take genlight objects.
* `plot_poppr_msn` now gives users the option to exclude the legends.
* Default plotting for `mlg.table` will no longer produce one plot per
  population. It will now produce a single ggplot object for all populations.
  Note that the bars are no longer colored by count.
* `poppr` will no longer calculate "Hexp". Instead, Simpson's index will be
  calumniated, but the old index can be retrieved by using (N/(N - 1))*lambda.
* `poppr` can now take any statistic that can be calculated from a table of
  multilocus genotype counts.
* `genind2genalex` gains the ability to selectively write different strata.

NEW FUNCTIONS
-----------

* `mlg.filter` will contract multilocus genotypes given a genetic distance and
  threshold using one of three algorithms. It can report statistics such as the
  multilocus genotypes returned, the number of samples within each multilocus
  genotype, the thresholds at which multilocus genotypes were collapsed, and the
  genetic distance matrix that represents the new multilocus genotypes.
* `filter_stats` will show you graphical output of all the algorithms in
  `mlg.filter`.
* `cutoff_predictor` will predict the cutoff threshold from `mlg.filter`.
* `bitwise.dist` can efficiently calculate absolute genetic distance for
  genlight objects.
* `mll` "multilocus lineages" is a new replacement for `mlg.vector` which gains
  the functionality of selecting the multilocus genotype definition from the mlg
  slot.
* `nmll` counts the number of multilocus lineages
* `mll.custom` allows the user to define custom multilocus genotypes.
* `mll.levels` allows the user to edit the names of custom multilocus genotypes.
* `poppr_has_parallel` will return `TRUE` if poppr was built with OpenMP
  parallel library.
* `win.ia` calculates windows of \bar{r}_d along genlight chromosomes.
* `samp.ia` calculates \bar{r}_d for genlight object by randomly sampling a
  user-defined number of SNPs.
* `test_replen` will test repeat lengths of microsatellite markers for
  consistency.
* `fix_replen` will fix inconsistent repeat lengths for microsatellite markers.
* `diversity_stats` returns a matrix containing diversity statistics. Defaults
  to 4 found in `poppr`, but can be extended to any statistic that can be
  calculated on a vector of MLG counts.
* `diversity_boot` will bootstrap a MLG matrix over the statistics specified for
  `get_stats`. Can also perform rarefaction bootstrap.
* `diversity_ci` will calculate and plot confidence intervals for bootstrap
  resampling of an MLG matrix. This includes rarefaction to the smallest sample
  size.
* `imsn` provides an interactive shiny interface for construction of minimum
  spanning networks.
* `pair.ia` will calculate the index of association for pairs of loci and plot
  heatmaps.

NEW CLASSES
-----------

* snpclone is an extension of the genlight object that acts very much like
  genclone. It contains an mlg slot.
* MLG is an internal class that lives inside the mlg slot of snpclone and
  genclone objects. It allows the user to easily switch between multilocus
  genotype definitions.

* The function `poppr` will no longer return rounded results, but rather is
  printed with three significant digits.

MISC
-----------

* Added unit tests.
* The poppr user manual has been shortened to only include instructions on data
  manipulation.

  calculations performed in poppr.

poppr 1.0.7
===========

UPDATE
-----------

* Updated README to include link to poppr google group.

BUG FIX UPDATE
-----------

* Made last bug fix more stable (corrected on ape side).

poppr 1.0.6
===========

BUG FIX
-----------

* Fixed bug for users who have downloaded ape version 3.1 or higher where
  bruvo.boot would throw an error.

MISC
-----------

* Updated citation information.

poppr 1.0.5
===========

NOTABLE CHANGE
-----------

* The default shuffling algorithm for calculating the index of association has
  changed from multilocus-style sampling to permutation of alleles. All of the 4
  methods are available, but new assignments are as follows: Method 1: permute
  alleles, Method 2: parametric bootstrap, Method 3: non-parametric bootstrap,
  Method 4: Multilocus-style sampling. Previously, Multilocus was 1 and the rest
  followed in the same order. There should be no compatibility issues with this
  change. Functions affected: `ia`, `poppr` `shufflepop`

BUG FIX
-----------

* Bootstrapping algorithm for `bruvo.boot` function was not shuffling the repeat
  lengths for each locus resulting in potentially erroneous bootstrap support
  values. This has been fixed by implementing an internal S4 class that will
  allow direct bootstrapping of the data and repeat lengths together.
* An occasional error, "INTEGER() can only be applied to a 'integer', not a
  'NULL'" in `bruvo.boot` or `bruvo.dist` fixed.

IMPROVEMENTS
-----------

* Changes to `bruvo.boot` allow for ever so slightly faster bootstrapping.

MISC
-----------

* Permutations for I_A and \bar{r}_d are now visualized as a progress bar as
  opposed to dots.

poppr 1.0.4
===========

BUG FIX
-----------

* A previous error where bootstrap values greater than 100 were reported from
  `bruvo.boot` on UPGMA trees has been fixed.
* Fixed correction of negative branch lengths using Kuhner and Felsenstein
  (1994) normalization for NJ trees.

MISC
-----------

* github repository for poppr has changed from github.com/poppr/poppr to
  github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr

poppr 1.0.3

-----------

* Function `informloci` will remove phylogenetically uninformative loci.

NAMESPACE
-----------

* Now importing specific functions from igraph and ape due to dependency issues.
* Removed igraph, ape, ggplot2, and phangorn form "Dependencies", but keeping
  them in "Imports".

-----------

* `read.genalex` will no longer insert an "X" in front of loci with numeric
  names.

poppr 1.0.2
===========

-----------

* Fixed bug in diss.dist function that would return an inflated distance for
  haploids.

DOCUMENTATION
-----------

* Added explanation for the index of association in poppr_manual.
* Expanded installation section to include installation instructions from
  github.

IMPROVEMENTS
-----------

* Algorithm for the index of association was updated to increase speed.

BUG FIXES
-----------

* Removed unnecessary rounding factor for missing data in `bruvo.dist`.
* Corrected handling of duplicate entries for `read.genind`.
* Input values that are not multiples of the specified repeat length for Bruvo's
  distance are now rounded (as opposed to being forced as integers).

MISC
-----------

* Vignette updated for aesthetics and to reflect algorithmic changes.

poppr 1.0.0
===========

MISC
-----------

* Poppr has been confirmed to work on Linux, Mac, and Windows systems with R
  3.0.0.

  to the list of files, so they can be read without switching working directory.
* information printed to screen from `missingno` and `mlg.crosspop` will now be
  wrapped to 80 characters.

BUG FIXES
-----------

* `poppr` will now be able to correctly recognize GenAlEx files with both
  geographic and regional data.
* calculation of the index of association on P/A data with missing values will
