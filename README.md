## Welcome 

Poppr is an R package designed for analysis of populations with mixed modes of 
sexual and clonal reproduction. It is built around the framework of [adegenet's](http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/)
genind object and offers the following implementations:

- clone censoring of populations at any of multiple levels of a hierarchy
- convenient counting of multilocus genotypes and sub-setting of populations with multiple levels of hierarchy
- define multilocus genotypes
- calculation of indices of genotypic diversity, evenness, richness, and rarefaction
- drawing of dendrograms with bootstrap support for genetic distances
- drawing of minimum spanning networks for genetic distances
- calculation of the index of association

or (<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7Br%7D_d" alt = "Standardized index of association">)
- batch processing on any server that has R ( &ge; 2.15.1) installed
- calculation of Bruvo's distance for microsatellite (SSR) markers (implemented in C for speed)
- import of data from and export to [GenAlEx](http://biology.anu.edu.au/GenAlEx/Welcome.html "GenAlEx Homepage")

### New in version 2.0:

- handling of genomic SNP data
- custom multilocus genotype definitions
- collapse multilocus lineages by genetic distance
- calculate reticulate minimum spanning networks
- calculate index of association in a sliding window across snps
- bootstrapping of MLG diversity statistics
- [interactive exploration of minimum spanning networks](https://github.com/zkamvar/poppr_msn_shiny)
- and more!

For full details, see the NEWS file or type in your R console:

```R

Additionally, if you use any following functionalities:

- minimum spanning networks with reticulation
- collapsing multilocus genotypes into multilocus lineages with `mlg.filter()`
- custom multilocus genotype definitions with `mlg.custom()`
- index of association for genomic data with `win.ia()` or `samp.ia()`
- bootstrapping any genetic distance with genind, genlight, or genpop objects with `aboot()`

## Known issues on CRAN

This R package is not a small package, and because of that, it is not unfathomable that there occasionally might be bugs. For bugs that exist within R code, they can be fixed by visiting https://gist.github.com/zkamvar/b64078a0d04d2452c905 and sourcing the code from there. Below is a list of known issues in version 2.0.2 that are fixed on GitHub, but not yet on CRAN:

- none! :)


## Installation

### From CRAN

Binary versions for mac and windows are available for R &ge; 2.15.1 [**here**](http://cran.r-project.org/package=poppr).

To install, make sure R is at least version 2.15.1 (the authors recommend &ge; 3.0), and in your console, type:

```R
install.packages("poppr")
```

If you want the absolute latest version of *poppr*, see about installing from github below.

***

### Stable and Development versions

To install this package from github, make sure you have the following:

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) (OSX)
    OR [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (Windows)
- [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) (to install, use: `install.packages("devtools")`)

For Linux users, make sure that the function `getOption("unzip")` returns `"unzip"` or `"internal"`. If it doesn't, then run `options(unzip = "internal")`.

Now you can use the `install_github()` function:

#### For the latest stable release:    

```R
devtools::install_github(repo = "grunwaldlab/poppr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("poppr")
```

#### For the bleeding edge (development) version:

```R
devtools::install_github(repo = "grunwaldlab/poppr@devel", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("poppr")
```
