#' MLG class
#' 
#' A class to store multilocus genotypes in genclone objects. This is intended
#' for internal use only.
#' 
#' @name MLG-class
#' @rdname MLG-class
#' @aliases MLG
#' @export
#' @slot mlg a list containing four vectors, one for each type of MLG 
#'   manipulation.
#' @slot visible a character specifying which MLG type is to be displayed and 
#'   accessed.
#' @slot distname the name of the distance function or matrix used to collapse 
#'   mlgs.
#' @slot distargs the arguments provided to compute the distance function.
#' @slot distalgo the algorithm used to contract multilocus genotypes.
#' @slot cutoff Two numbers specifying the cutoff value for expanding and 
#'   collapsing MLGs.

#'  m[1:10, all = TRUE] # still class MLG
