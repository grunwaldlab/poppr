    <p>Internally, this function works by converting the data into a 
  <code><a href='http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pegas/topics/read.loci'>loci</a></code> object, which represents genotypes as a data 
  frame of factors. Random samples are taken of 1 to n-1 columns of the 
  matrix and the number of unique rows are counted to determine the number of
  multilocus genotypes in that random sample. This function does not take 
  into account any definitions of MLGs via <code><a href='mlg.filter.html'>mlg.filter</a></code> or 
  <code><a href='mll.custom.html'>mll.custom</a></code>.</p>
