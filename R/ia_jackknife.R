#==============================================================================#
# bootjack is a function that will calculate values of the index of association
# after sampling with or without replacement. The purpose of this function is
# to help determine distributions of I_A under non-random mating by creating 
# exact copies of samples by sampling with replacement and also to derive a
# distribution of the data by sampling a subset of the data (63% by default)
# without replacement. 
#
# Since the data itself is not being changed, we can use the distances observed.
# These distances are calculated per-locus and presented in a matrix (V) with the
# number of columns equal to the number of loci and the number of rows equal to
# choose(N, 2) where N is the number of samples in the data set. Sampling has
# been optimized with this strategy by first creating a lower triangle distance
# matrix containing indices from 1 to choose(N, 2). This is then converted to a
# square matrix (mat) and subset after sampling with or without replacement. The
# remaining indices in the distance matrix is used to subset the distance-per-
# locus matrix (V). Calculations are then performed on this matrix. It must be
# noted that for sampling with replacement, duplicated indices must be
# supplemented with rows of zeroes to indicate no distance.

#' @param reps an integer specifying the number of replicates to perform.
