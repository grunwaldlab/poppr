\title{Produce a basic summary table for population genetic analyses.}
\usage{
poppr(dat, total = TRUE, sublist = "ALL", blacklist = NULL, sample = 0,
  method = 1, missing = "ignore", cutoff = 0.05, quiet = FALSE,
  clonecorrect = FALSE, strata = 1, keep = 1, hist = TRUE,
  index = "rbarD", minsamp = 10, legend = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{a \code{\linkS4class{genind}} object OR a
  \code{\linkS4class{genclone}} object OR any fstat, structure, genetix,
  genpop, or genalex formatted file.}

\item{total}{When \code{TRUE} (default), indices will be calculated for the
  pooled populations.}

\item{sublist}{a list of character strings or integers to indicate specific
  population names (accessed via \code{\link[adegenet]{popNames}}).
  Defaults to "ALL".}

\item{blacklist}{a list of character strings or integers to indicate specific
  populations to be removed from analysis. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{sample}{an integer indicating the number of permutations desired to
  obtain p-values. Sampling will shuffle genotypes at each locus to simulate
  a panmictic population using the observed genotypes. Calculating the
  p-value includes the observed statistics, so set your sample number to one
  off for a round p-value (eg. \code{sample = 999} will give you p = 0.001
  and \code{sample = 1000} will give you p = 0.000999001).}

\item{method}{an integer from 1 to 4 indicating the method of sampling
  desired. see \code{\link{shufflepop}} for details.}

\item{missing}{how should missing data be treated? \code{"zero"} and
  \code{"mean"} will set the missing values to those documented in
  \code{\link{tab}}. \code{"loci"} and \code{"geno"} will remove any loci or
  genotypes with missing data, respectively (see \code{\link{missingno}} for
  more information.}

\item{cutoff}{\code{numeric} a number from 0 to 1 indicating the percent
  missing data allowed for analysis. This is to be used in conjunction with
  the flag \code{missing} (see \code{\link{missingno}} for details)}

\item{quiet}{\code{FALSE} (default) will display a progress bar for each
  population analyzed.}

\item{clonecorrect}{default \code{FALSE}. must be used with the \code{strata}
  parameter, or the user will potentially get undesired results. see
  \code{\link{clonecorrect}} for details.}

\item{strata}{a \code{formula} indicating the hierarchical levels to be used.
  The hierarchies should be present in the \code{strata} slot. See
  \code{\link{strata}} for details.}

\item{keep}{an \code{integer}. This indicates which strata you wish to keep
  after clone correcting your data sets. To combine strata, just set keep
  from 1 to the number of straifications set in strata. see
  \code{\link{clonecorrect}} for details.}

\item{hist}{\code{logical} if \code{TRUE} (default) and \code{sampling > 0},
  a histogram will be produced for each population.}

\item{index}{\code{character} Either "Ia" or "rbarD". If \code{hist = TRUE},
  this will determine the index used for the visualization.}

\item{minsamp}{an \code{integer} indicating the minimum number of individuals
  to resample for rarefaction analysis. See \code{\link[vegan]{rarefy}} for
  details.}

\item{legend}{\code{logical}. When this is set to \code{TRUE}, a legend
  describing the resulting table columns will be printed. Defaults to
  \code{FALSE}}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed on to \code{\link{diversity_stats}}}
}
\value{
\item{Pop}{A vector indicating the population factor} \item{N}{An
  integer vector indicating the number of individuals/isolates in the
  specified population.} \item{MLG}{An integer vector indicating the number
  of multilocus genotypes found in the specified population, (see:
  \code{\link{mlg}})} \item{eMLG}{The expected number of MLG at the lowest
  common sample size (set by the parameter \code{minsamp}.} \item{SE}{The
  standard error for the rarefaction analysis} \item{H}{Shannon-Weiner
  Diversity index} \item{G}{Stoddard and Taylor's Index}
  \item{lambda}{Simpson's index} \item{E.5}{Evenness} \item{Hexp}{Nei's gene
  diversity (expected heterozygosity)} \item{Ia}{A numeric vector giving the
  value of the Index of Association for each population factor, (see
  \code{\link{ia}}).} \item{p.Ia}{A numeric vector indicating the p-value for
  Ia from the number of reshufflings indicated in \code{sample}. Lowest value
  is 1/n where n is the number of observed values.} \item{rbarD}{A numeric
  vector giving the value of the Standardized Index of Association for each
  population factor, (see \code{\link{ia}}).} \item{p.rD}{A numeric vector
  indicating the p-value for rbarD from the number of reshuffles indicated in
  \code{sample}. Lowest value is 1/n where n is the number of observed
  values.} \item{File}{A vector indicating the name of the original data

\code{\link[=poppr-package]{package?poppr}}

This function allows the user to quickly view indices of heterozygosity,
evenness, and linkage to aid in the decision of a path to further analyze
a specified dataset. It natively takes \code{\linkS4class{genind}} and
\code{\linkS4class{genclone}} objects, but can convert any raw data formats
that adegenet can take (fstat, structure, genetix, and genpop) as well as
genalex files exported into a csv format (see \code{\link{read.genalex}} for
details).

\details{
This table is intended to be a first look into the dynamics of
  mutlilocus genotype diversity. Many of the statistics (except for the the
  index of association) are simply based on counts of multilocus genotypes
  and do not take into account the actual allelic states. None of the
  diversity indices will be bootstrapped if \code{sample > 0}. These are
  relatively quick to bootstrap, so the function
  \code{\link{diversity_stats}} should suit the need to produce confidence
  intervals for these statistics. \subsection{graphic}{This function outputs
  a \pkg{ggplot2} graphic of histograms. These can be manipulated to be
  visualized in another manner by retrieving the plot with the
  \code{\link{last_plot}} command from \pkg{ggplot2}. A useful manipulation
  would be to arrange the graphs into a single column so that the values of
  the statistic line up: \cr \code{p <- last_plot(); p +
  facet_wrap(~population, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")}\cr The name for the
  groupings is "population" and the name for the x axis is "value".}
}
\note{
The calculation of \code{Hexp} has changed from \pkg{poppr} 1.x. It was
  previously calculated based on the diversity of multilocus genotypes,
  resulting in a value of 1 for sexual populations. This was obviously not
  Nei's 1978 expected heterozygosity. We have thus changed the statistic to
  be the true value of Hexp by calculating \eqn{(\frac{n}{n-1}) 1 - \sum_{i =
  1}^k{p^{2}_{i}}}{(n/(n - 1))*(1 - sum(p^2))} where p is the allele
  frequencies at a given locus and n is the number of observed alleles (Nei,
  1978) in each locus and then returning the average. Caution should be
  exercised in interpreting the results of Hexp with polyploid organisms with
  ambiguous ploidy. The lack of allelic dosage information will cause rare
  alleles to be over-represented and artificially inflate the index. This is
  especially true with small sample sizes.

# The previous version of poppr contained a definition of Hexp, which

# Simpson's index. This statistic was originally included in poppr because it
# was originally included in the program multilocus. It was finally figured
# to be an unbiased Simpson's diversity metric (Lande, 1996; Good, 1953).
