poppr 1.1.4.99
===========
NEW FEATURES
* The default plot for the index of association will now be a single histogram. The user has the option to visualize the standardized index of association (`index = "rbarD"`, default) or the classic index of association (`index = "Ia"`). If the user uses the function `ia` with the argument `valuereturn = TRUE`, then the resulting object can be plotted with the plot function. 
* The function `poppr` will now plot all populations in a single faceted plot instead of one plot per population.
* `aboot` and `bruvo.boot` will now be able to utilize any function to generate trees (suggested in issue #18).
* The mlg slot in the genclone object can now optionally hold an MLG class object. This object will contain different definitions of multilocus genotypes, allowing the user to switch between observed, custom, and mlgs defined given a genetic distance threshold.
* minimum spanning network functions gain the ability to include reticulations using the option `include.ties`
* minimum spanning network functions gain the ability to collapse multilocus genotypes by genetic distance with the option `threshold`.

NEW FUNCTIONS
* `mlg.filter` will contract multilocus genotypes given a genetic distance and threshold using one of three algorithms. It can report statistics such as the multilocus genotypes returned, the number of samples within each multilocus genotype, the thresholds at which multilocus genotypes were collapsed, and the genetic distance matrix that represents the new multilocus genotypes.
* `bitwise.dist` can efficiently calculate absolute genetic distance for genlight objects. 
* `mll` "multilocus lineages" is a new replacement for `mlg.vector` which gains the functionality of selecting the multilocus genotype definition from the mlg slot.
* `nmll` counts the number of multilocus lineages
* `mll.custom` allows the user to define custom multilocus genotypes.
* `mll.levels` allows the user to edit the names of custom multilocus genotypes.
* `poppr_has_parallel` will return `TRUE` if poppr was built with OpenMP parallel library.
* `win.ia` calculates windows of \bar{r}_d along genlight chromosomes.
* `samp.ia` calculates \bar{r}_d for genlight object by ranomly sampling a user-defined number of SNPs.
* `test_replen` will test repeat lengths of microsatellite markers for consistency.
* `fix_replen` will fix inconsistent repeat lengths for microsatellite markers.

NEW CLASSES
* snpclone is an extension of the genlight object that acts very much like genclone. It contains a hierarchy and mlg slot. 
* MLG is an internal class that lives inside the mlg slot of snpclone and genclone objects. It allows the user to easily switch between multilocus genotype definitions.

BUG FIX
* Fixed internal bug for `fix_negative_branch` when only one branch had a negative edge.
* Fixed bug in `diss.dist` where a single locus would return an error.
* Fixed bug in `poppr.amova` where a single locus would return an error due to `repool_haplotypes`.

BUG FIX
* Fixed issue where monomorphic loci would cause an error in `recode_polyploids`
* Fixed logical error that would cause The infinite alleles model of Bruvo's distance to inflate the distance. (Found by Michael Metzger. Addresses issue #5).
* AMOVA can now take subset genclone objects (Addresses issue #7).
* in `mlg.table`, the mlgsub argument will now subset by name instead of index (fixed in #7).
* Fixed issue for neighbor-joining trees where the internal function to fix negative branch lengths was accidentally shuffling the corrected branches. Addresses issue #11.
* `diss.dist` can now be used with `aboot`

MISC

* attempted to make model choices for Bruvo's distance more clear in the documentation

* `setpop` will set the population of a `genclone` object utilizing model formulae regarding the hierarchy slot.
* `as.genclone` will automatically convert genind objects to genclone objects.
* `is.genclone` checks the validity of genclone objects.
* `poppr.amova` will run amova on any hierarchical level. This also includes the feature to run amova on clone censored data sets. It utilizes the ade4 version of amova. 
* `info_table` will calculate missing data per population per locus or ploidy per individual per locus and gives the user the option to visualize this as a heatmap.
* `locus_table` will calculate diversity and evenness statistics over all loci in a genind or genclone object.
* `*.dist` functions will calculate Nei's distance, Rogers' Distance, Edwards' Distance, Reynolds' Distance, and Provestis' Distance.

NEW CAR
* Not really.

NAMESPACE CHANGES
* poppr no longer depends on pegas.
* ade4 and reshape2 are now explicitly required.

IMPROVEMENTS
* default shuffling algorithm has been implemented in C to increase speed.
* output of the mlg functions are now represented as integers to decrease their size in memory.
* `mlg.matrix` is now calculated faster utilizing R's internal tabulating capabilities.
* The function `poppr` will no longer return rounded results, but rather is printed with three significant digits.

MISC

* A new vignette, "Algorithms and Equations" gives algorithmic details for calculations performed in poppr. 

poppr 1.0.7
===========
UPDATE
* Updated README to include link to poppr google group.

BUG FIX UPDATE
* Made last bug fix more stable (corrected on ape side).

poppr 1.0.6
===========
BUG FIX
* Fixed bug for users who have downloaded ape version 3.1 or higher where bruvo.boot would throw an error. 

MISC
* Updated citation information.

poppr 1.0.5
===========
NOTABLE CHANGE
* The default shuffling algorithm for calculating the index of association has changed from multilocus-style sampling to permutation of alleles. All of the 4 methods are available, but new assignments are as follows: Method 1: permute alleles, Method 2: parametric bootstrap, Method 3: non-parametric bootstrap, Method 4: Multilocus-style sampling. Previously, Multilocus was 1 and the rest followed in the same order. There should be no compatibility issues with this change. Functions affected: `ia`, `poppr` `shufflepop`

BUG FIX
* Bootstrapping algorithm for `bruvo.boot` function was not shuffling the repeat lengths for each locus resulting in potentially erroneous bootstrap support values. This has been fixed by implementing an internal S4 class that will allow direct bootstrapping of the data and repeat lengths together.
* An occasional error, "INTEGER() can only be applied to a 'integer', not a 'NULL'" in `bruvo.boot` or `bruvo.dist` fixed.

IMPROVEMENTS
* Changes to `bruvo.boot` allow for ever so slightly faster bootstrapping.

MISC
* Permutations for I_A and \bar{r}_d are now visualized as a progress bar as opposed to dots.

* A previous error where bootstrap values greater than 100 were reported from `bruvo.boot` on UPGMA trees has been fixed. 
* Fixed correction of negative branch lengths using Kuhner and Felsenstein (1994) normalization for NJ trees.

MISC
* github repository for poppr has changed from github.com/poppr/poppr to github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr
