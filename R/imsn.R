#' Create minimum spanning networks interactively
#' 
#' This function will launch an interactive interface that allows you to create,
#' plot, manipulate, and save minimum spanning networks. It runs using the
#' \pkg{shiny} R package.
#' 
#' @return NULL, invisibly
#' 
#' @details Creating and plotting MSNs requires three steps:
#' 
#' \enumerate{
#' \item Create a distance matrix from your data
#' \item Create a minimum spanning network with your data and the matrix
#' \item Visualize the minimum spanning network}
#' The function \code{\link{plot_poppr_msn}} is currently the most flexible way
#' of visualizing your minimum spanning network, but with 20 parameters, it can
#' become pretty intimidating trying to find the right display for your MSN. 
#' 
#' With this function, all three steps are combined into one interactive 
#' interface that will allow you to intuitively modify your minimum spanning 
#' network and even save the results to a pdf or png file. 
#' 
#' @section Interface:
#' \subsection{Buttons}{
#' In the left hand panel, there are three buttons to execute the functions.
#' These allow you to run the data set after you manipulate all of the
#' parameters.
#' 
#' \itemize{
#' 
#' \item \strong{GO!} - This button will start the application with the
#' specified parameters
#' \item \strong{reData} - Use this button when you have changed any parameters
#' under the section \strong{Data Parameters}. This involves recalculating the
#' distance matrix and msn.
#' \item \strong{reGraph} - Use this button when you have changed any parameters
#' under the section \strong{Graphical Parameters}. This involves superficial
#' changes to the display of the minimum spanning network.
#' 
#' }
#' }
#' 
#' \subsection{Tabs}{
#' 
#' The right hand panel contains different tabs related to your data set of
#' choice.
#' 
#' \itemize{
#' 
#' \item \strong{Plot} - The minimum spanning network itself
#' \item \strong{Data} - A display of your data set
#' \item \strong{Command} - The commands used to create the plot. You can copy
#' and paste this to an R file for reproducibility.
#' \item \strong{Save Plot} - This provides a tool for you to save the plot to a
#' PDF or PNG image.
#' \item \strong{Session Information} - displays the result of
#' \code{\link{sessionInfo}} for reproducibility.

#'   # It is also possible to run this from github if you are connected to the internet.

#'   shiny::runGitHub("grunwaldlab/poppr", subdir = "inst/shiny/msn_explorer")
#' 
#'   # You can also use your own distance matrices, but there's a small catch.
#'   # in order to do so, you must write a function that will subset the matrix
#'   # to whatever populations are in your data. Here's an example with the above
#  ' # data set:
#' 
#'   mondist <- bruvo.dist(monpop, replen = monpop_ssr)
#'   myDist <- function(x, d = mondist){
#'    dm <- as.matrix(d)          # Convert the dist object to a square matrix
#'    xi <- indNames(x)           # Grab the sample names that exist
#'    return(as.dist(dm[xi, xi])) # return only the elements that have the names
#'                                # in the data set
#'   }
#'   # After executing imsn, choose:
#'   # Distance: custom
#'   # myDist
#'   imsn() 
#' }
#' }
#' @import shiny
imsn <- function(){
  shiny::runApp(system.file("shiny", "msn_explorer", package = "poppr"))
  invisible(NULL)
