/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reassigns genotypes from mlg into new clusters based on a minimum genetic distance
between clusters using one of three clustering algorithms. 
The result will be a new list of mll assignments based on those rules.

Input: A square matrix of numeric distances between each pair of samples.
       A vector of initial mlg assignments for each sample.
       A real used to govern the minimum distance between clusters/mlls.
       A string determining the algorithm to use. Must start with a lowercase
        "n", "f", or "a". Representing "nearest neighbor", "farthest neighbor",
        and "average neighbor" (otherwise known as UPGMA) respectively.
       An integer representing the number of threads that should be used.
Output: A vector of mll assignments based on the algorithm and threshold used.

  // This function uses various clustering algorithms to
  // condense a set of multilocus genotypes into a potentially smaller
  // set. Clusters closer than threshold apart will be merged together,
  // and the process will repeat until no remaining clusters are close
  // enough to be merged. Farthest Neighbor clustering is the strictest,
  // (clustering only groups whose extremes are nearest) and is therefore 
  // used as the default. Nearest Neighbor is the least strict, and is
  // prone to linking vastly different individuals into the same cluster
  // if there is a path between them. Average Neighbor takes the average
  // distance between all pairs of points in two clusters, then merges
  // the pair of clusters with the smallest average distance.
