## What is *poppr*?

*Poppr* is an R package designed for analysis of populations with mixed modes of 
sexual and clonal reproduction. It is built around the framework of [adegenet's](http://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/)
genind and genlight objects and offers the following implementations:

- clone censoring of populations at any of multiple levels of a hierarchy
- convenient counting of multilocus genotypes and sub-setting of populations with multiple levels of hierarchy
- define multilocus genotypes
- calculation of indices of genotypic diversity, evenness, richness, and rarefaction
- drawing of dendrograms with bootstrap support for genetic distances
- drawing of minimum spanning networks for genetic distances
- calculation of the index of association 
(<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?I_A" alt = "Index of association">)
or (<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7Br%7D_d" alt = "Standardized index of association">)
- batch processing on any server that has R ( &ge; 2.15.1) installed
- calculation of Bruvo's distance for microsatellite (SSR) markers (implemented in C for speed)
- import of data from and export to [GenAlEx](http://biology.anu.edu.au/GenAlEx/Welcome.html "GenAlEx Homepage")

### New in version 2.0:

- handling of genomic SNP data
- custom multilocus genotype definitions
- collapse multilocus lineages by genetic distance
- calculate reticulate minimum spanning networks
- calculate index of association in a sliding window across snps
- bootstrapping of MLG diversity statistics
- [interactive exploration of minimum spanning networks](https://github.com/zkamvar/poppr_msn_shiny)
- and more!

For full details, see the NEWS file or type in your R console:

```R
news(Version >= "2.0.0", package = "poppr")
```

Additionally, if you use any following functionalities:

- minimum spanning networks with reticulation
- collapsing multilocus genotypes into multilocus lineages with `mlg.filter()`
- custom multilocus genotype definitions with `mlg.custom()`
- index of association for genomic data with `win.ia()` or `samp.ia()`
- bootstrapping any genetic distance with genind, genlight, or genpop objects with `aboot()`

## Installation

### From CRAN

[Binary versions for mac and windows are available for R &ge; 2.15.1 **here**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=poppr).

To install, make sure R is at least version 2.15.1 (the authors recommend &ge;
3.0), and in your console, type:

```R
install.packages("poppr")
```

If you want the absolute latest version of *poppr*, see about installing from
github below.

***

### Stable and Development versions

To install this package from github, make sure you have the following:

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) (OSX)
    OR [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (Windows)
- [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) (to install, use: `install.packages("devtools")`)

For Linux users, make sure that the function `getOption("unzip")` returns
`"unzip"` or `"internal"`. If it doesn't, then run `options(unzip =
"internal")`.

Once you have devtools and a C compiler installed, you can use the 
`install_github()` function to install the current version from github.

#### Stable version

This release will contain bug fixes and new, documented, and stable features 
that will be included in future releases. Note: if you don't have LaTeX
installed, you should set `build_vignettes = FALSE`.

```R
devtools::install_github(repo = "grunwaldlab/poppr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("poppr")
```

#### Unstable/Development versions

All new features in testing will be released on different branches. These 
features will be in various stages of development and may or may not be 
documented. Install with caution. The below command would install features on 
the the branch called "devel". Note that these branches might be out of date
from the master branch.

```R
devtools::install_github(repo = "grunwaldlab/poppr@devel", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("poppr")
```
